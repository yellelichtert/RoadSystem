# Road System - Unity Editor Tool

## Description

**Road System** is a Unity editor tool designed to make the creation of roads, intersections, and waypoints for 3D games easier and more efficient. This tool allows developers to procedurally generate roads and intersections while automatically placing waypoints for pathfinding. The system aims to streamline city-building, racing, or any other genre requiring road layouts with built-in pathfinding abilities.

## Features

- **Procedural Road Generation**: Automatically generate roads with smooth, interconnected paths.

- **Intersection Generation**: Create intersections between roads with configurable settings.

- **Pathfinding Utility**: Integrated support for pathfinding, making it easier to move AI or characters along roads.

- **Waypoint System**: Automatically place waypoints along roads for pathfinding.
- **Custom Editor Window**: Access the tool from a custom editor window with a user-friendly interface for controlling road creation and settings.

## Installation

At this point in time there is no version ready for release. Once we are ready to release the tool can be found at the Unity Asset Store.

### Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 or later (may change depending on future updates).
- No specific dependencies at this time.

## Usage

1. Open the custom editor window by navigating to **Window > Road System**.
2. Use the provided buttons and sliders to draw roads, create intersections, and generate waypoints for pathfinding.
3. Adjust settings such as road width, intersection type, and waypoint placement to suit your project’s needs.

(Example use case will be added in the future.)

## Future Features

- Curved intersection edges.
- Manual drawing for intersections when auto-generation fails.
- Road speed limits.
- Multiple lane support.
- Traffic system integration.
- And more…
